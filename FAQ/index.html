<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-tcp-and-udp"><ins> <u> What is the difference between TCP and UDP? </u> </ins></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When clients establish a connection with each other, they follow a common protocol when doing so to ensure that all clients can communicate with each other. This is handled at the Transport layer in the OSI model. The OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection and is a model used by software developers and hardware manufacturers to create a standardized set of guidelines so these different technologies can inter operate with each other.</p>
<p><code>a</code> <span style="background-color: pink;"> <u> UDP(User Datagram Protocol) </u> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol and is one of the types of Internet Protocols your client would use to form a connection with another client or server you are trying to connect to. UDP is what is known as a “connection-less” oriented protocol. This means that it doesn’t establish a session with the server or client you are connecting to meaning data delivery is not guaranteed. For example, when a website is sending data back to your client, it will send out all its data/packets to your client and does not care if any data/packets are lost along the way. This means that you might not be able to get all the data/packet required for a functionality or whatever event you are trying to do at the moment. This is typically not ideal for situations such as file transfers/downloading because you might not get all the packets from the download leading to an incomplete or corrupt file. Another example where its bad is when you are trying to load a website. If packets are lost during the response, your client won’t be able to properly render the website to how it was intended to look or perhaps a functionality on the website will not work. However, there are instances where UDP is preferred, such as video chatting. If packets are lost during video chatting or streaming a video, you might get missing pixels in the video but the service is still usable despite packet loss as oppose to TCP, where the service would not work unless all packets are confirmed to have reached their destination. UDP is also faster than TCP since it doesn’t have to check if all the packets were received at the other end.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>b</code> <span style="background-color: pink;"> TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) </span></p>
<ul>
<li>TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. Like UDP, it is the other type of Internet Protocol your client would use to form a connection with the other client or server you want to connect to. Unlike UDP, TCP is a “connection-oriented” protocol meaning it establishes a session and makes sure it is good and reliable so you can send data correctly. A TCP connection makes sure all packets are received at the other end of the connection and will resend the packet if the packet gets lost along the way. This means that you are guaranteed to receive information you requested and in the correct order it is meant to be sent. This does mean it is slower than a UDP connection since it has to check if the packet its sending has been received by the other party but is very useful in a lot of the things we do on the internet. For example, if you are trying to view a website, you would want all the functionalities to be there as well as the information displayed in the correct order. Another example is when you are downloading a file, you would want to make sure you get the entire file and not just parts of a file that becomes unusable or corrupt.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="background-color: gold;"> Both UDP and TCP have their advantages and disadvantages. It really depends on what is prioritized to choose the right Internet Protocol to use. Most websites in the current day use a combination of both depending on what services are being used and what needs to be delivered. </span></p>

<h2 id="what-platforms-are-supported-by-r-type"><ins> <u> What platforms are supported by R-type? </u> </ins></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The platforms the game can run on are Windows and Linux.</p>
<p><img alt="Window" src="../window.png" /></p>
<p>Windows operating system is a computer program that manages all computer resources and provides services to applications that run on top of it. This operating system was developed by Microsoft and released in 1985 under the name Windows.</p>
<p><img alt="Linux" src="../linux.png" /></p>
<p>Linux is a Unix-like, open source and community-developed operating system (OS) for computers, servers, mainframes, mobile devices and embedded devices. It is supported on almost every major computer platform, including x86, ARM and SPARC, making it one of the most widely supported operating systems.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-language-used-to-create-the-r-type-product"><ins> <u> What is the language used to create the R-type product? </u> </ins></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The programming language used for the R-type product relationship is <span style="background-color: gold;">C++ </span>.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: gold;"> C++  is a programming language: it is therefore used to write computer applications. It is also one of the most used programming languages today.</span></p>
<p>C++ is created from the C language, whose functionalities it extends: C++ allows in particular object-oriented programming (OOP).</p>

<h2 id="what-motivated-the-creation-of-projet-r-type"><ins> <u> What motivated the creation of Projet R-type? </u> </ins></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Already the R-type Project is an academic project of the third year. We decided to work on this project because successful completion of it gives us 6 credits. Adding bonuses and additional features can allow us to go up to 2 more credits. In short, we designed this project for academic purposes and also to validate our year because the project is part of a road block.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-you-contribute-and-improve-r-type"><ins> <u> How can you contribute and improve R-type? </u> </ins></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Awesome! As an open source project, R-type thrives off of the innovation and the ambition of developers like you.</p>
<p>The best way to start contributing to R-type is by using it and reporting any issues that you might experience. A good bug report with clear reproduction steps helps your fellow contributors fix bugs quickly and efficiently. You can also report issues you find in the online documentation.</p>
<p>To contribute to the project you can write directly to one of the contributors. They will try to answer you and therefore provide you with a guide to continue improving.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-the-next-version-be-released"><ins> <u> When will the next version be released? </u> </ins></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently we are at the first version of the project. The parts currently designed are, in other words, only part 0 and part 1 which consist respectively of the documentation, dependency management and the prototype of the game playable on the network.</p>

<h2 id="i-have-a-great-idea-for-r-type-how-can-i-share-it"><ins> <u> I have a great idea for R-type. How can I share it? </u> </ins></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an idea or contribution to share regarding the project, do not hesitate to write to one of the project contributors. By going to the Contributor page you will see the contact details of the different people who worked on the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="does-r-type-use-an-ecs-entity-component-system"><ins> <u> Does R-type use an ECS (Entity Component System)? </u> </ins></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the game runs and works on an ECS which has several features.
Our ECS contains properties such as the collider which allows you to manage collisions between different elements. In addition, it contains the transform property which allows you to manage the movement. It contains the position of the entities.</p>
